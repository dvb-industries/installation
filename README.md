Installation
============

Ideas how to setup a work laptop.

Hardware
--------

I have bought a [Dell Inspiron 17R][laptop].

Software
--------

### Operating System

The operating system will be base upon [Ubuntu][ubuntu] because

1. provisioning of Linux machines is superior.
2. I am familiar with [Ubuntu][ubuntu].

I will opt for a [Long Term Support][LTS], which means I will be
settling for [12.04][].

### Shell

I grew fond of the [fish shell][]. It can be installed from their
[PPA][fish-PPA]. To set is as the default shell use [chsh][].
